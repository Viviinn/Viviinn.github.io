<h3>This work is called "Bomb Time", I tried to pop a balloon in 25 different places and at different times to explore people's reactions. At the same time, I also recorded people's reactions, subtle emotional changes and body movements when they heard or saw the balloon explode. It was also discovered that we sometimes pay too much attention to our own behavior. In many of the videos, no one cares about such a strange behavior even in the noisy streets with people coming and going.

    In the streets, in front of stores, on the beach, with the sudden sound of balloons exploding, the rush of people coming and going may tend to prohibit, have turned their heads to look at the people stepping on the balloons, their faces showing incomprehension, confusion and curiosity. After a moment's stay, people resume their daily routine. This seemingly mischievous act is also the author's test of the relationship between the surrounding characters.
