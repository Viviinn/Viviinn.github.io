                  of it. Not every poem is finished—one poem is abandoned, another catches fire and is carried away by
                  the wind, which may be an ending, but it is the ending of a poem without an end.<br /></span

                  that i have never forgotten it: the opening line of a poem, he said, is like finding a fruit on the
                  ground, a piece of fallen fruit you have never seen before, and the poet’s task is to create the tree
                  from which such a fruit would fall.<br /></span

                  group of thinkers who believe that in the beginning was the Act. that nothing can precede action—no
                  breath before act, no thought before act, no pervasive love before some kind of act.<br /></span
