          <p class="an-act-of-the-mind helvetica-bold-black-43px">
            An act of the mind. To move, to make happen, to make manifest. Be an act of Congress. A state of real
            existence rather than possibility. And poets love possibility! They love to wonder and explore. Hard lot!
            But the poem, no matter how full of possibility, has to exist! To conduct oneself, to behave. How a poem
            acts marks its individual character. A poem by Glandolyn Blue does not sound like a poem by Timothy Sure. to
            pretend, feign, impersonate. That, too, yes and always, because self-consciousness is its own pretension,
            and has been from its beginning; the human mind is capable of a great elastic theatre. As the poet Ralph
            angel puts it, “The poem is an interpretation of weird theatrical shit.” the weird theatrical shit is what
            goes on around us every day of our lives; an animal of only instinct, Johnny Ferret, has in his actions
            drama, but no theater; theater requires that you draw a circle around the action and observe it from outside
            the circle; in other words, self-consciousness is theatre.<br /><br />Everyone knows that if you query poets
            about how their poems begin, the answer is always the same: a phrase, a line, a scrap of language, a rhythm,
            an image, something seen, heard, witnessed, or imagined. And the lesson is always the same, and young poets
            recognize this to be one of the most important lessons they can learn: if you have any idea for a poem, an
            exact grid of intent, you are on the wrong path, a dead-end alley, at the top of a cliff you haven’t even
            climbed. This is a lesson that can only be learned by trial and error.<br /><br />I believe many fine poems
            begin with ideas, but if you tell too many faces this, or tell it too loudly, they will get the wrong idea.

          <p class="i-believe-the-poem-i helvetica-bold-black-43px">
            I believe the poem is an act of the mind. I think it is easier to talk about the end of a poem than it is to
            talk about its beginning. Because the poem ends on the page, but it begins off the page, it begins in the
            mind. The mind acts, the mind wills a poem, often against our own will; somehow this happens, somehow a poem
            gets written in the middle of a chaotic holiday party that has just run out of ice, and it&#39;s your house.

            Now here is something really interesting (to me), something you can use at a standing-up-only party when
            everyone is tired of hearing there are one million three-thousand-two-hundred-ninety-five words used by the
            Esimo for snow. This is what Ezra Pound learned from Ernest Fenollosa: Some languages are so
            constructed—English among them—that we each only really speak one sentence in our lifetime. That sentence
            begins with your first words, toddling around the kitchen, and ends with your last words right before you
            step into the limousine, or in a nursing home, the night-duty attendant vaguely on hand. Or, if you are
            blessed, they are heard by someone who knows you and loves you and will be sorry to hear the sentence
            end.<br /><br />When I told Mr. Angel about the lifelong sentence, he said: “That’s a lot of semicolons!” he
            is absolutely right; the sentence would be unwieldy and awkward and resemble the novel of a savant, but the
            next time you use a semicolon (which, by the way, is the least-used mark of punctuation in all of poetry)
            you should stop and be thankful that there exists this little thing, invented by a human being—an Italian as
            a matter of fact—that allows us to go on and keep on connecting speech that for all apparent purposes is
            unrelated.<br /><br />You might say a poem is a semicolon, a living semicolon, what connects the first line
            to the last, the act of keeping together that whose nature is to fly apart. Between the first and last lines
            there exists—a poem—and if it were not for the poem that intervenes, the first and last lines of a poem
            would not speak to each other.<br /><br />Would not speak to each other. Because the lines of a poem are
            speaking to each other, not you to them or they to you.
