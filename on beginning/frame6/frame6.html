    <p class="an-act-of-the-mind helvetica-bold-black-43px">
        An act of the mind. To move, to make happen, to make manifest. Be an act of Congress. A state of real
        existence rather than possibility. And poets love possibility! They love to wonder and explore. Hard lot!
        But the poem, no matter how full of possibility, has to exist! To conduct oneself, to behave. How a poem
        acts marks its individual character. A poem by Glandolyn Blue does not sound like a poem by Timothy Sure. to
        pretend, feign, impersonate. That, too, yes and always, because self-consciousness is its own pretension,
        and has been from its beginning; the human mind is capable of a great elastic theatre. As the poet Ralph
        angel puts it, “The poem is an interpretation of weird theatrical shit.” the weird theatrical shit is what
        goes on around us every day of our lives; an animal of only instinct, Johnny Ferret, has in his actions
        drama, but no theater; theater requires that you draw a circle around the action and observe it from outside
        the circle; in other words, self-consciousness is theatre.<br /><br />Everyone knows that if you query poets
        about how their poems begin, the answer is always the same: a phrase, a line, a scrap of language, a rhythm,
        an image, something seen, heard, witnessed, or imagined. And the lesson is always the same, and young poets
        recognize this to be one of the most important lessons they can learn: if you have any idea for a poem, an
        exact grid of intent, you are on the wrong path, a dead-end alley, at the top of a cliff you haven’t even
        climbed. This is a lesson that can only be learned by trial and error.<br /><br />I believe many fine poems
        begin with ideas, but if you tell too many faces this, or tell it too loudly, they will get the wrong idea.

      <p class="i-believe-the-poem-i helvetica-bold-black-43px">
        I believe the poem is an act of the mind. I think it is easier to talk about the end of a poem than it is to
        talk about its beginning. Because the poem ends on the page, but it begins off the page, it begins in the
        mind. The mind acts, the mind wills a poem, often against our own will; somehow this happens, somehow a poem
        gets written in the middle of a chaotic holiday party that has just run out of ice, and it&#39;s your house.
